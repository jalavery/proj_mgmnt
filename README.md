Feb 2020: Thanks to all who came to the RLadies presentation on timetrackR on February 26! The current version of timetrackR works in conjunction with an Excel file where you log your hours, but I am in the process of updating to be compatible with exports directly from toggl. I am planning to release this update by the end of April. Stay tuned! 

Abstract: While tracking time may seem like a mundane task that in and of itself consumes your time, if monitored and assessed regularly it can be useful to create a record of your work and to identify potential areas for improving efficiency. The timetrackR Shiny app provides a high-level summary of active, inactive and upcoming projects, as well as visualizations for the percentage of time spent by project or project investigator, number of hours spent on each project, and a timeline framing each projectâ€™s trajectory from planning through analysis and manuscript preparation. With the option to filter by year, investigator and analyst, the app is versatile enough to use for an individual or for an entire team as well as for use on a regular basis and for year-end or longer-term reviews of how time was spent. I will highlight the key features of the app and demonstrate how to integrate into your current workflow.
